Thereupon the gods held a council and resolved <br />to make Balder secure against every danger. So the goddess <span style="font-style:italic">Frigg</span> <br />took an oath from fire and water, iron and all metals, stones and <br />earth, from trees, sicknesses and poisons, and from all four-footed <br />beasts, birds and creeping things, that they would not hurt Balder. <br />When this was done <span class="name"><span style="font-style:italic">Balder</span></span> was deemed invulnerable; so the gods <br />amused themselves by setting him in their midst, while some shot at <br />him, others hewed at him, and others threw stones at him. But <br />whatever they did, nothing could hurt him; and at this they were all <br />glad.</p></blockquote><p><span class="quote">‘Only <span class="name"><span style="font-style:italic">Loki</span></span>, the mischief maker, was displeased, and he went in the guise of an old women to <span style="font-style:italic">Frigg</span>, who told him that the weapons of the gods could not hurt Balder, since she had made them all swear not to hurt him. Then Loki asked, <span class="quote">‘have all things sworn to spare Balder?’</span> She answered, <span class="quote">‘East of Valhalla grows a plant called <span style="font-style:italic">mistletoe</span>; it seemed to me too young to swear’</span>. So Loki went and pulled the <span style="font-style:italic">mistletoe</span> and took it to the assembly of the gods. There he found the blind god <span style="font-style:italic">Hother</span> standing at the outside of the circle. Loki asked him, <span class="said">‘Why do you not shoot at Balder?’</span><span class="name"><span style="font-style:italic">Hother</span></span> answered, <span class="said">‘Because I do not see where he stands; besides I have no weapon.’</span> Then said Loki, <span class="said">‘Do like the rest and show Balder honour, as they all do. I will show you where he stands, and do you shoot at him with this twig.’</span> <span class="name"><span style="font-style:italic">Hother</span></span> took the <span style="font-style:italic">mistletoe</span> and threw it at Balder, as <span class="name"><span style="font-style:italic">Loki</span></span> directed him. The <span style="font-style:italic">mistletoe</span> struck Balder and pierced him through and through, and he fell down dead. For a while the gods stood speechless, then they lifted up their voices and wept bitterly.’</span></p><!--TEI back--><div class="stdfooter autogenerated"><div class="footer"><!--standard links to project, institution etc--><a class="plain" href="/">Home</a> </div><address>Sir James George Frazer.
