When I fast time played video games on my personal computer.
Sometimes, I had impress by the storyline that describe in the games.
The way the game creators combine the story of myth or historical events into their game,
always makes me want to dig out the stories further. For example, the use of the story about god Balder.
In the famous video game, God of War lV.

# Balder and mistletoe and Loki

**The Death of Balder In God of War IV**

In the game God of War IV, the story of Kratos has moved from Greek Mythology to Norse Mythology.
In the new storyline, the adventure no longer about the revenge to Greek God, but the adventure of
him and his son-Atreus. At the end of the game, we know his really name was Loki. Balder, the son of
Frigg(Freya) as the main antagonist made most of the trouble to Kratos and Loki. Like what had been
told in legend, Balder is invincible. no one can hurt him, but a tiny plant-Mistletoe. In the original
myth, Hodur(Höðr), the brother of Balder, killed Balder with mistletoe, which was given by Loki. However,
in God of War IV, Balder was killed by Loki with mistletoe arrow.

# The Death of Balder In Golden Bough

## The Golden Bough: A Study in Comparative Religion

**James Frazer**

[Chapter 61]

“Once upon a time Balder dreamed heavy dreams which seemed to forbode his death. Thereupon the gods held a council and resolved to make Balder secure against every danger. So the goddess Frigg took an oath from fire and water, iron and all metals, stones and earth, from trees, sicknesses and poisons, and from all four-footed beasts, birds and creeping things, that they would not hurt Balder. When this was done Balder was deemed invulnerable; so the gods amused themselves by setting him in their midst, while some shot at him, others hewed at him, and others threw stones at him. But whatever they did, nothing could hurt him; and at this they were all glad.”

“Only Loki, the mischief maker, was displeased, and he went in the guise of an old women to Frigg, who told him that the weapons of the gods could not hurt Balder, since she had made them all swear not to hurt him. Then Loki asked, ‘have all things sworn to spare Balder?’ She answered, ‘East of Valhalla grows a plant called mistletoe; it seemed to me too young to swear’. So Loki went and pulled the mistletoe and took it to the assembly of the gods. There he found the blind god Hother standing at the outside of the circle. Loki asked him, ‘Why do you not shoot at Balder?’ Hother answered, ‘Because I do not see where he stands; besides I have no weapon.’ Then said Loki, ‘Do like the rest and show Balder honour, as they all do. I will show you where he stands, and do you shoot at him with this twig.’ Hother took the mistletoe and threw it at Balder, as Loki directed him. The mistletoe struck Balder and pierced him through and through, and he fell down dead. For a while the gods stood speechless, then they lifted up their voices and wept bitterly.”
