_When we talk about histories or historical events in video games.
Assassin's Creed series is definitely the one talked most by players.
This game is developed by Ubisoft Montreal. In this game people will find
that, it was easier to look for some historical attractions or stories.
In order to increase the sense of reality, Ubisoft tries to restore some landmark.
For Example, Notre Dame De Paris, Hagia Sophia, Big Ben，and so on. Also, they
add some historical figures and events to help improve the sense of reality.

_Notre Dame De Paris or Notre Dame Cathedral Paris, the name of this landmark architecture means
"Our Lady of Paris". It is a Gothic cathedral located in the Capital of France - Paris. The time
used to build this cathedral is about 300 years, since it began on 12th Century._
>Building work began on the Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris  way back in the 12th century,  it was not until some 300 years later construction finally came to an end.  It is now  one of the most prominent cathedrals in France and one of the oldest ones too.

_When this famous cathedral has been mentioned, I think a very famous historical figure
should be notice too. That is Joan of Arc, or known as Jeanne d'Arc in French. The Notre
Dame Cathedral is the place that this famous figure experience her **[beatification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beatification)**. About her biography, I cite the information from the website of [Notre Dame Cathedral Paris](https://notredamecathedralparis.com/)._

>In 1909 Joan of Arc was famously beatified in the Notre Dame Cathedral by Pope Pius X.  The brave young girl who told all she had experienced visions from God, went on to assist the French in conflicts with English soldiers. The French trusted her word and ultimately won many battles against England. As a big fan of the royals she also played a part in the crowning of Charles Vll. However not everyone was convinced by her religious visions and beliefs and she was later killed by Burundians’ who accused her of heresy and burned her at the stake.  It was not until 1456 that her name was cleared and she became known as an innocent martyr.

_Unfortunately, right now, if you want to go to Paris to see the true beauty of this historical attraction, it is impossible, because in April 15 2019, this famous cathedral suffered from a structure fire. This fire damage the part beneath the roof._

### Briefly Introduce of Big Ben
cited from **[Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org/)**:
>Big Ben is the nickname for the Great Bell of the striking clock at the north end of the Palace of Westminster; the name is frequently extended to refer to both the clock and the clock tower. The official name of the tower in which Big Ben is located was originally the Clock Tower; it was renamed Elizabeth Tower in 2012 to mark the Diamond Jubilee of Elizabeth II, Queen of the United Kingdom.

>The tower was designed by Augustus Pugin in a neo-Gothic style. When completed in 1859, its clock was the largest and most accurate four-faced striking and chiming clock in the world. The tower stands 315 feet (96 m) tall, and the climb from ground level to the belfry is 334 steps. Its base is square, measuring 39 feet (12 m) on each side. Dials of the clock are 23 feet (7.0 m) in diameter. On 31 May 2009, celebrations were held to mark the tower's 150th anniversary.

So, It is needless to say, right now, the game companies are noticed the importance of humanities related to game content creation.
The use of humanities stuffs. For example, the music, the historical attractions, and the literature works. It helps the game create some more educational and meaningful results. Also a plot cite from humanity works helps to game become vivid too. The adaptation of game The Witcher 3 base on the novel The Witcher series by Andrzej Sapkowski. The promotion of the game, helps to create more derived products. Like the music album of The Witcher 3. From this point of view, I can say, right now, the humanities and game creation are closely related from now on.
